## **Features**Â 

### **Context Variables are now called Account Variables: Check out the differences and updates**

**Context Variables** are now called **Account Variables**, with changes that simplify the use and configuration of responses for Inputs within StackSpot.

#### **What are Account Variables?**

In StackSpot, **Account Variables** were created to make developers' work more accessible by reducing the repetition of responses for Inputs during the configuration of Stacks, Plugins, and Actions. These Variables are created and pre-configured by **Account Holders** or **Account Administrators** so that repetitive Input responses are not manually entered every time.

#### **Why use Account Variables?**

These variables allow the creation of a **friendly name** to reference reusable values across various parts of StackSpot, such as Plugins, Actions, Applications, and Infrastructures. It centralizes the management of these values, making updates fast and efficient.

#### **How do Account Variables work?**

Account Variables are interpolated in actions such as applying Plugins, executing Actions, creating Infrastructures and Workflows, and simplifying and automating operations within StackSpot.
This improvement aims to provide more flexibility and reduce errors, allowing you to quickly and efficiently configure responses throughout your StackSpot.

### **Nunjucks Support for Jinja Expressions**

The **StackSpot Portal** now supports **Nunjucks**, a template engine that enhances Jinja expressions. This brings more flexibility to creating **Plugins** and **Actions**while keeping the familiar Jinja syntax (`{{ ... }}` for variables and `{% ... %}` for control structures). However, **Nunjucks does not support all Jinja features**, especially those relying on Python-native functionalities.

- **Example:** [**`computed-inputs`**](/en/create-use/create-content/yaml-files/advanced-inputs) in the Portal during Application or Infrastructure creation.

- **Compatibility:** Works both in the **CLI** and the **StackSpot Portal**.
To check for potential incompatibilities, [**use this `codepen`**](https://codepen.io/renanrodrigueszup/pen/XWLyvKB?editors=0011). More details in the [**official Nunjucks FAQ**](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/faq.html#can-i-use-the-same-templates-between-nunjucks-and-jinja2-what-are-the-differences).
