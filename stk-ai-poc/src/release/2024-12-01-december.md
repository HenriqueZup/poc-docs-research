### **New StackSpot Account Portal**

The StackSpot account management now has a new domain: [**https://myaccount.stackspot.com**](https://myaccount.stackspot.com). This change aims to enhance the user experience by centralizing profile and organization settings in a more intuitive and organized environment.

  1. **My Profile:** Displays information about the logged-in user, including:
    - Roles;
    - Permission Groups;
    - Accessible Resources.

  2. **Organization:** Displays organization settings, now organized into three categories:
    - **Products:** Specific settings for EDP, Cloud Service, and AI products.
    - **Identity & Security:** Includes SSO, Event History, and Service Credentials.
    - **Access Management:** Management of Users, Permission Groups, and Roles/Permissions.

#### **Documentation Impact:**

The documentation menu has been updated to reflect the new portal organization, ensuring consistency between the user interface and the available guides.
